My name is Shadab Iqbal
I am currently studying undergrad at Brac University
My current CGPA is 3.78
But to be honest, I do not run for good grades
What I actually run for is, high skills
I am very much passionate about developing and growing my skills 
And those skills starts from Programming 
And goes to all sectors and branches which covers up almost everything.
Thats all I had to talk about today.
Talk to you later
Thanks a lot, everyone.
